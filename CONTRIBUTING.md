# Contributing to Color Combine 
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. In this document you will find how you can do it and what steps you have to follow to do it.

## How to contribute ðŸ› 
1. **Fork the repository:** To do this, click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.
2. **Clone the newly created fork:** After performing the "fork" in the previous step, clone the repository to your machine. To do this, open git and put the command `git clone <FORK URL>` in the place where you want to save the repository on your machine. The "fork url" is obtained by entering your "fork" and clicking the green "Code" button.
3. **Add the original repository as remote:** This is done to keep the fork up to date. This is done by opening git in the same place where the repository is on the machine and entering the command `git remote add upstream <URL OF THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY>`. The "url of the original repository", as in the previous point, is obtained by clicking on the green "Code" button, but this time in the original repository instead of in the "fork".
4. **Install dependencies:** To install the dependencies you must enter the `npm install` command.
5. **Contribute to the code:** Now all that remains is your contribution to the code. Manage the changes in your fork and update your fork of the main branch to have it updated to the latest versions.
6. **Upload the changes:** When you finish your changes and have the "commit" made in your "fork", create a Pull Request (PR) with a description of the changes made and the reason for them. It is advisable to include a photo if necessary for the explanation.

## Recommendations ðŸ’¡
- Look at the different PRs there may be before uploading a new PR so that no two PRs are the same.
- Update your branch to have the latest versions.
